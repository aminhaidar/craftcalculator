## Implementation Recommendations

### UI/UX Priority
1. **Roll Length** should be prominently displayed in product cards
2. **Design Type** should be the primary visual identifier
3. **Ribbon Type** should be clearly visible but secondary
4. **Brand** should be available but not prominent

### Filter Order (Like Craft Outlet)
1. Roll Length
2. Design Type  
3. Ribbon Type
4. Brand
5. Colors
6. Theme

### Search Priority
1. Design Type (most searched)
2. Ribbon Type
3. Colors
4. Theme
5. Brand

## Database Schema Recommendations

```sql
-- Primary fields (indexed for fast filtering)
roll_length_yards: INTEGER
design_type: VARCHAR(50)
ribbon_type: VARCHAR(50)
brand: VARCHAR(100)

-- Secondary fields
colors: TEXT[]
theme: VARCHAR(100)
width_inches: DECIMAL(3,2)
wired: BOOLEAN
cost_per_yard: DECIMAL(6,2)
```

## Cost Calculator Integration

The ribbon categorization should support:
- **Cost per yard** calculations based on roll length
- **Yards used** calculations for bow making
- **Waste calculations** based on roll length vs. usage
- **Inventory tracking** by roll length and design type

## Conclusion

This categorization system prioritizes the fields that matter most to bow makers and crafters, following the same pattern used by major ribbon suppliers like Craft Outlet. The focus is on practical, cost-effective ribbon selection that supports accurate pricing and inventory management.
